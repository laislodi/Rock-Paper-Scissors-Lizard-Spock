# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock

(This description can be found in [fandom.com](https://bigbangtheory.fandom.com/wiki/Rock,_Paper,_Scissors,_Lizard,_Spock))

Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock is a game of chance that expands the traditional game of [Rock, Paper, Scissors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors). It is first used to settle a dispute about what to watch on TV between [Sheldon](https://bigbangtheory.fandom.com/wiki/Sheldon_Cooper) and [Raj](https://bigbangtheory.fandom.com/wiki/Rajesh_Koothrappali) in ["The Lizard-Spock Expansion"](https://bigbangtheory.fandom.com/wiki/The_Lizard-Spock_Expansion).

It's mentioned again in ["The Rothman Disintegration"](https://bigbangtheory.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rothman_Disintegration), where Sheldon explains the rules to [Penny](https://bigbangtheory.fandom.com/wiki/Penny) and [Barry Kripke](https://bigbangtheory.fandom.com/wiki/Barry_Kripke).

The game was originally created by [Sam Kass](https://bigbangtheory.fandom.com/wiki/Sam_Kass) with Karen Bryla. According to an interview with Kass, the series producers did not originally ask for permission to use the game, but Kass was officially referenced by Sheldon as the creator of the game during the ["The Rothman Disintegration"](https://bigbangtheory.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rothman_Disintegration), after which he states, "Hail Sam Kass!" to which [Leonard](https://bigbangtheory.fandom.com/wiki/Leonard_Hofstadter), [Howard](https://bigbangtheory.fandom.com/wiki/Howard_Wolowitz), Raj, and Sheldon all then chant "Hail!" while raising their hands.

## Rules

The game is an expansion on the game Rock, Paper, Scissors, with the additional hand signs of Lizard (resembling a hand puppet), and Spock (the Vulcan Salute). Each player picks a variable and reveals it at the same time. The winner is the one who defeats the others. In a tie, the process is repeated until a winner is found.

Almost always, the boys will all pick [Spock](https://bigbangtheory.fandom.com/wiki/Spock) at the same time and tie over and over again.
